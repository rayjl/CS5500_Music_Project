Notes:

WAVE format:

If a <pathname> preceded by the "-f" option ends in ".wav",
that file must be in little-endian (RIFF) WAVE format with
PCM encoding (AudioFormat 1), stereo or mono, 8- or 16-bit
samples, with a sampling rate of 11.025, 22.05, 44.1, or
48 kHz.

MP3 format:

If the <pathname> ends in ".mp3", that file must be in the
MPEG-1 Audio Layer III format (MP3).

Agenda:

(DONE) Fix dam script such that it can execute with directory paths
utilize CD command


Notes for searching for substrings:
String Search Algorithms
- Boyer-Moore String Search
- Rabin-Karp Multi-Pattern string Search

- Look over Algorithms for efficient methods
- precomputation ; memoization
- dynamic programming
- geeksforgeeks should have some decent implementations

Incremental Recomputation
Fingerprints with hashtable for efficiency

Interleaving of Algorithms
Slow algorithm that always works
Fast algorithm that doesn't always work
- reason why is because possible hash collisions
- by combining the 2 -> 'fast' algorithm that will always work

How to read floating point numbers accurately
- use obvious algorithm
- look at the low-order bits of the next-to-last step
- if those bits are 10000000xxx, you have to use a slower algorithm
- otherwise you're done

Iterative Widening
- The equal? procedure must always terminate even if its arguments
  contan cycles

Finding Roots with Binary Search
f(x) = 2x^3 - 5x^2 - 16x + 2
f(0) = 2
f(1) = -17
